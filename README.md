# Projects
All these folders are source code for C++ projects and python projects I've done over my college years.
The websiteSource folder shows the code for eshpy.pythonanywhere.com, only the home page has javascript, the rest of the pages are run by python flask
YoutubeRPG has its own readme but its the code for youtube live comments remote controlling an android emulator. https://youtu.be/b8qk-pBinsE is a showcase of the code
